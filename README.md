In this courswork you will explore various deep learning functionalities through implementing a number of pytorch neural network operations/layers and creating your own deep learning model and methodology for a high dimensional classification problem.

Part1: 

In this part, you will use basic Pytorch operations to define the 2D convolution, 2D max pooling, linear layer, as well as 2D batch normalization operations.


Part2:

In this part, you will design, train, and optimize a custom deep learning model for classifying the Food-101 dataset. This dataset, widely used for food classification tasks, contains 101 classes representing a diverse range of popular dishes from around the world.
